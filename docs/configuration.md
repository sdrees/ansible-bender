# Configuration

## Target image metadata

With dockerfiles, this is being usually done with instructions such as `LABEL`,
`ENV` or `EXPOSE`. Bender supports two ways of configuring the metadata:

* Setting specific Ansible variables inside your playbook.
* CLI options of `ansible-bender build`.


### Via playbook vars

Configuration is done using a top-level Ansible variable `ansible_bender`. All
the values are nested under it. The values are processed before a build starts.
The changes to values are not reflected during a playbook run.

If your playbook has multiple plays, the `ansible_bender` variable is processed
only from the first play. All the plays will end up in a single container image.


#### Top-level keys

| Key name                  | type   | description
|---------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------
| `base_image`              | string | name of the container image to use as a base
| `buildah_from_extra_args` | string | extra CLI arguments to pass to buildah from command
| `ansible_extra_args`      | string | extra CLI arguments to pass to ansible-playbook command
| `working_container`       | dict   | settings for the container where the build occurs
| `target_image`            | dict   | metadata of the final image which we built
| `cache_tasks`             | bool   | When true, enable caching mechanism
| `layering`                | bool   | When true, snapshot the image after a task is executed
| `squash`                  | bool   | When true, squash the final image down to a single layer
| `verbose_layer_names`     | bool   | tag layers with a verbose name if true (image-name + timestamp), defaults to false


#### `working_container`

| Key name             | type            | description                                                          |

| `user`               | string          | UID or username to invoke the container during build (run ansible)   |

#### `target_image`


| Key name             | type            | description                                                          |
|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`               | string          | name of the image                                                    |
| `labels`             | dict            | key/value data to apply to the final image                           |
| `annotations`        | dict            | key/value data to apply to the final image (buildah/runc specific)   |
| `environment`        | dict            | implicit environment variables to set in a container                 |
| `cmd`                | string          | a default command to invoke the container                            |

| `volumes`            | list of strings | a list of paths which are meant to be hosted outside of the container|
| `working_dir`        | string          | path to a working directory within a container image                 |


Example of a playbook with variables:

```
- hosts: all
  vars:
    ansible_bender:
      base_image: "docker.io/library/python:3-alpine"
      buildah_from_extra_args: "--dns 8.8.8.8"
      ansible_extra_args: "-vvv"

      working_container:
        volumes:
          - "{{ playbook_dir }}:/src"

      target_image:
        name: challet
        labels:
          x: y
        environment:
          asd: '{{ playbook_dir }}'
```

Before bender processes the variables, it runs a no-op playbook so that Ansible
expand them. Therefore you can utilize some of the Ansible's native variables.
Please bear in mind that most of the facts won't be available.
