This is a tool which bends containers using
[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)
[playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html)
and turns them into container images. It has a pluggable builder selection â€”
it is up to you to pick the tool which will be used to construct your container
image. Right now the only supported builder is
[buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah).
[More](http://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-bender/issues/25) [to
come](http://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-bender/issues/26) in the future.
Ansible-bender (ab) relies on [Ansible connection
plugins](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.6/plugins/connection.html) for
performing builds.

tl;dr Ansible is the frontend, buildah is the backend.

The concept is described in following blog posts:
* [Building containers with buildah and ansible](https://blog.tomecek.net/post/building-containers-with-buildah-and-ansible/).
* [Ansible and Podman Can Play Together Now](https://blog.tomecek.net/post/ansible-and-podman-can-play-together-now/).

You may be asking: why not
[ansible-container](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container)? Ansible bender is
actually heavily inspired by ansible-container: the main distinction is that
ansible-container covers the complete lifecycle of a containerized application
while ab takes care of image builds only.


**Status**: ready to be used

Ansible-bender was recently moved to the ansible-community organization. \o/

## Features

* You can build your container images with buildah as a backend.
* Ansible playbook is your build recipe.
* You are able to set various image metadata via CLI or as specific Ansible vars:
  * working directory
  * environment variables
  * labels
  * user
  * default command
  * exposed ports
* You can do volume mounts during build.
* Caching mechanism:
  * Every task result is cached as a container image layer.
  * You can turn this off with `--no-cache`.
  * You can disable caching from a certain point by adding a tag `no-cache` to a task.
* You can stop creating new image layers by adding tag `stop-layering` to a task.
* If an image build fails, it's committed and named with a suffix `-[TIMESTAMP]-failed` (so
  you can take a look inside and resolve the issue).
* The tool tries to find python interpreter inside the base image.
* You can push images you built to remote locations such as:
  * a registry, a tarball, docker daemon, ...
  * [podman push](https://github.com/containers/libpod/blob/master/docs/podman-push.1.md) is used to perform the push.
